# Datatypes
## `Integer`
In Python an `int` can hold abritrarily big numbers and there is no difference between a signed or
unsigned value as the example shows.

```{python}
3423489032 * 3498234
````
You can use `type` to check the type of a given variable

```{python}
type(3423489032)
````
```{python}
type('I am Adrian')
````
## Operators
The operators in Python are very similar to the ones in `Java` for instance.
I want to point out the ones that are different which are the logical operators.
### Logical Operators
* not
* and
* or

```{python}
a = True
b = False
c = True

print(a and b)
print(a and c)
````
```{python}

d = False
e = False

def someFunc(a, c):
  
  if(a==True and not(c)):
    print("evaluating to True")
  elif(a or c):
    print("evaluating either or")
  else:
    print("evaluating to false")

someFunc(a, not c)
someFunc(a, c)
someFunc(d, e)
````
### Overloading of an operator
Important to note is that every `operator` can have a different function according
to how they are defined within an object. This is called overloading.


## `Floats`
Floating point numbers are called `floats` in programming. They are stored as sequence
of bits. Therefore they can loose precision. A division will always result in a float
 
```{python}
5/3
print("type is:", type(5/3))
````
If you use a dot at the end of the number it will be interpreted as a float even if it's an integer.
```{python}
5. + 1
print("type is:", type(5.))
````
## `Booleans`
In Boolean Algebra there are only two values present: `True` and `False`. These two values are also represented as 0 and 1.
They can be used with the operators we discussed earlier. Here are some examples

```{python}
True and True
1 and 1
False or True
0 or 1
True and not False
1 and not 0
````

### Laziness of evaluation
It is important to know that python evaluates `and`, `or` and `not` in a lazy manor.
Also known as boolean shortcut. That means if the left operand already holds the result
than the left one is ignored. This is always the case for the conjunction with `and`.
If the left value is already False python will automatically evaluate to False.

```{python}
False and False
````
## `Strings`

Strings are used to represent characters in Python. They always have to go in between quotes or else they are interpreted as part
of the syntax.The `String` object has various methods that operat on a given sequence of characters.

```{python}
a_string = 'I am a string'
print("Length : ", len(a_string))
```

### `+` and `*` Operators
The `+` operator concatenates multiple strings to one.

```{python}
a_string = 'I am a string'
b_string = 'and I am a second string'

print("Concatenation : ", a_string+b_string)
```
On the other hand causes the `*` operator to concatenate the exact same string multiple times.
```{python}
a_string = 'Multiply me '
n = 5
print("Concatenation of the same string n-times: ", a_string*n)
```

### `in` Operator
The `in` operator checks if a single char or a sequence of chars is contained within a string.

```{python}
a_string = 'search'
b_string = 'I am contained in the search'

print("Is in ? : ", a_string in b_string)
print("Is not in ? : ", a_string not in b_string)
```
The same behavior is true for a list of strings.

```{python}
a_string = 'search'
b_string = ['I', 'am', 'contained', 'in', 'the', 'search']

print("Is in ? : ", a_string in b_string)
```
But it is not true for comparing to lists of strings.
```{python}
a_string = ['I', 'am', 'contained', 'in', 'the', 'search']
b_string = ['I', 'am', 'contained', 'in', 'the', 'search']

print("Is in ? : ", a_string in b_string)
```
## Various methods on `Strings`

### `dir` commmand
In order to get an extensive list of all available functions for the class of string you can use the `dir` command.
```{python}
dir(str)
```

It returns a list of all functions that can be called on a string. The functions that start with `__` are called magic functions. They implement various operators such as
'__add__' and '__mul__'. We have already talked about them in a previous section.    
Let's checkout some of the other functions.

### `endswith`
This method checks if a string ends with the characters of another string.
```{python}
a_string = 'some random string'

# endswith
print('ends with?:',  a_string.endswith('string'))
print('ends with?:',  a_string.endswith('elefant'))
```
It's important to understand that some of the methods are only available with strings and are not part of the python namespace. I will show you what I mean by that

```{python}
print('Available in string namespace ?', type(str.endswith))
```
This example shows you that `endswith` is only a valid function when applied to strings.

### `replace`
As the name suggests the `replace` method replaces a single character or a set of chars within a string. It takes two arguemtns. The first argument is
the string that should be replaced the second is the sequence that should be there instead.
Let's see how it works in action.

```{python}
a_string = 'abbbbbbc'
print('Replace b with x', a_string.replace('b', 'x'))
```
### `split`
In order to dive a string at a given character you can use the `split` method. It takes the delimiter as a parameter and returns a list of single chars.
Here is an example.

```{python}
a_string = 'Those | are | different | words'
print('Split at |', a_string.split('|'))
```

It also works without a specific delimiter. But I think this only works for whitespaces in between the characters.
```{python}
a_string = 'Those are different words'
print('Split', a_string.split())
```
