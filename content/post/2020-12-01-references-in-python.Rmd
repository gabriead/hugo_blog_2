# References
## References in Python
In contrast to languages like C++ oder C Python does not allow tow write directly to memory.
Python uses references to objects that are bound to variables.

### Surprising Behavior
In this example nothing interesting happens until we print the two lists.
```{python}
l = ['Hello', 'World', 'here', 'I', 'am']
r=l
r[0] = 1000
print("list l {}".format(l))
print("list r {}".format(l))
print("Address of l {}".format(id(l)))
print("Address of r {}".format(id(r)))
````
By adding an element to r we also mutated l. This comes as kind of a surprise.
In order to understand what is going on behind the curtain let's take a look at
what happens in memory. This can be done by using `id`.

```{python}
y = 0
x = 2
print("current address of x: {}".format(id(x)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(y)))

y = x
print("current address of y  after referencing x: {}".format(id(y)))

y = 4

print("current address of x after y has changed: {}".format(id(x)))
print("current address of y after new value was assigned: {}".format(id(y)))
print("current value of x: {}".format(x))
print("current value of y: {}".format(y))
````
We observe that the `id` of y changes after referencing to x and changes again when a
new value is assigned. The address of x does not change even if the value of y is altered again.
Let's checkout another example.
```{python}
y=x
x=y
print("current address of x: {}".format(id(x)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(y)))

x=x+2
print("current address of x: {}".format(id(x)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(y)))
````
It is noteworthy that after incrementing the value of x, the variable is assigned a new id in memory.
Operators such as `-`, `*` and `/` or `**` **always create a new reference**.

The behavior that we have observed for variables of type `int` is also true for `strings`.
Watch this.

```{python}
s='Hello'
print("current address of s: {}".format(id(s)))
s=s+str(1)
print("Value of s: {}".format(s))
print("current address of s after addition: {}".format(id(s)))
````
It is good to know that Python automatically takes care of the 'old' and unused reference and removes it from memory.

## Excercise
Given two lists `l1` and `l2`. Explain the behavior for each of the possibilities of adding an element.
```{python}
l1 = [1,2,3]
l2 = l1

print("current address of x: {}".format(id(l1)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(l2)))

# Appending an element with the '+' operator
l2 = l2 + [100]
l1
l2
````

```{python}
l1 = [1,2,3]
l2 = l1

print("current address of x: {}".format(id(l1)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(l2)))

# Appending an element by indexing
l2[2]= 100
l2
l1
````

```{python}
l1 = [1,2,3]
l2 = l1

print("current address of x: {}".format(id(l1)))
print("current address of y: {}".format(id(l2)))

# Appending an element with 'append'
return_value = l2.append(100)
l2
l1
print("Return value of append {}".format(return_value))
````


## Solutions
### Excrecise 1
The `+` operator always creates a new reference. Therfore l2 is assigned with a new reference
that is different than the one before. `Append` does add an element in situ and does **not**
create a new reference. Therefore l1 and l2 are still referencing the same `id` in memory.
