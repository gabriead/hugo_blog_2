## Kontrollaufgabe 1.7

```{python}
path = "/Users/AdrianG/Desktop/HS-Albstadt-Sigmaringen/Python_for_programming/Faust_complete.txt"
b = open(path).read()
c = open(path).readlines()
c[:5]
```



## Enumerator vs. Map
Consider you are getting a list of sentences and want to attach a line number to every sentence within the map. There are two possibilities to achieve that.
```{python}
txt = ['The Project Gutenberg EBook of Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil, by \n', 'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n', '\n', '  Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil\n', '\n']

# 1. possibility => use an enumerator
txt_with_line_numbers = list(enumerate(txt))
#xt_with_line_numbers

# 2. possibility => use map

def mapL(func, *args):
  return list(map(func, *args))

compute_line_numbers= lambda x : mapL(lambda line_counter,line: (line_counter, line), range(len(x)), x)
print(compute_line_numbers(txt))

```
The important take away here is that you have to find a way of generating incrementing numbers within the map function. This is done by using the range function, which generates
numbers from 0 to the length of the input.

## Map vs. list comprehension
Let's use the list we already know and pretend that we want to know the line which has the most words. How could we achieve that?
```{python}
txt = ['The Project Gutenberg EBook of Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil, by \n', 'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n', '\n', '  Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil\n', '\n']

# 1. possibility => use map
max(mapL(lambda line: (len(line), line), txt))

# 2. possibility => use list comprehension
max([(len(line), line) for line in txt])
```
We see that both methods output the same result. For me the main take away here is that you can use a tuple to store the relevant information
and process this later on.
Consider you want to retrieve the line that contains the most vowels that start with a small letter. To tell you the truth I don't see any good solution
using `map` here.
Let's see an example.
```{python}
txt = ['The Project Gutenberg EBook of Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil, by \n', 'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n', '\n', '  Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil\n', '\n']

# 1. possibility => use list comprehension
max([ (len([word for word in line.split() if word[0] in 'aeiou' and word.lower()]), line) for line in txt])
```
Consider now that you want to compute the line with the greatest average length of words per line.

```{python}
txt = ['The Project Gutenberg EBook of Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil, by \n', 'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n', '\n', '  Faust: Der Tragödie erster Teil\n', '\n']

# 1. possibility => use list comprehension
from statistics import mean

def myMean(aList):
    if len(aList)>0:
        return mean(aList)
    else:
        return 0

max([ ( myMean([len(word) for word in line.split()]), line) for line in txt])

# 2. possibility => use map
max(mapL(lambda line: (myMean(mapL(len, line.split())), line), txt))
```

## `filter` function
The `filter` function is written as filter(<predicate>, <sequence>).
Looks more complicated than it is. Let's see a few examples.
```{python}
list(filter(lambda x: x%3==0, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]))
```
As with map we can define a wrapper function that will make life easier for us.
```{python}

def myFilter(predicate, sequence):
  return list(filter(predicate, sequence))
  
# We can also define it with a lambda function

myFilter_lambda = lambda predicate , sequence: list(filter(predicate, sequence))

myFilter(lambda x: x%2==0, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
myFilter_lambda(lambda x: x%2==0, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
```
The best way to get familiar with functional style programming is by doing it.
Let's consider some practical examples.
```{python}

def myFilter(predicate, sequence):
  return list(filter(predicate, sequence))
  
# We can also define it with a lambda function

myFilter_lambda = lambda predicate , sequence: list(filter(predicate, sequence))

myFilter(lambda x: x%2==0, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
myFilter_lambda(lambda x: x%2==0, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
```


## Nested for-loops with list comprehensions or `zip`


```{python}
[(x,y) for x in "hallo" for y in [1,2]]
````

## `reduce` Function
The reduce function is another tool in functional programming. It lives in the `functools` package and has to be imported.
This function combines the items of sequence one after the other.It goes from left to right.
It can be written as reduce(function,sequence). Let's look at a few examples.

```{python}
from functools import reduce
## Summing up all uneven numbers in a range
reduce(lambda x,y: x+y , range(1,1000, 2))

f = lambda x,y: x+'\n'+y
reduce(f,['Erste Zeile', 'Zweite Zeile', 'Dritte Zeile'])

````
Let's reimplement the `min` and `max` function using `reduce`.


```{python}
from functools import reduce
## Summing up all uneven numbers in a range
reduce(lambda x,y: x+y , range(1,1000, 2))

f = lambda x,y: x+'\n'+y
reduce(f,['Erste Zeile', 'Zweite Zeile', 'Dritte Zeile'])

````
